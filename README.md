# pacman
Pacman using Verilog VGA for CS M152A. This code was written using Xilinx IDE.

**Note**: this is a simplified version of Pac-Man with only one ghost. Score is displayed on the connected Basys3 FPGA board.

Use the board's top, bottom, left, and right buttons for direction control and the center button for pausing. See the report.pdf for more detailed descriptions and schematics.

Developed by Samuel Perrott and Ray Hsiao.
